# ApexHeroSuitProject

This began as an exploratory side project for one of my brother-in-law's companies... (with his permission of course). It is the administrative dashboard app for a company survey form which must be completed by many employees in many different companies. From the root page, the administrator can navigate through the database of companies and company employees, and each employee can be forwarded a link to their particular company user form. From here, answers to the survey questions populate a Google Sheet and are then processed in various ways. Each employee may submit multiple forms at different times, and so the graphing possibilities are endless.

Although this is visually sparse and relatively unstyled, my main purpose here was to explore another relational database with Spring Boot, and also how this can be connected to a spreadsheet. Data can be viewed in so many ways!
